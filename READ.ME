# HealthCare Analytics Disease Prediction
<h1>Abstract</h1> 
Diabetes is a widespread chronic condition that requires early diagnosis for effective management. This study evaluates and compares the performance of three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—for predicting diabetes using health-related features. The goal was to identify the most accurate and balanced model based on key evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results show that Logistic Regression outperforms the other models, achieving the highest accuracy (76%) and a strong balance between precision (67%) and recall (64%). These findings suggest that Logistic Regression is a reliable and interpretable model for diabetes prediction, offering potential benefits for early screening and improved healthcare decision-making. l
